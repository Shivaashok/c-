#include <stdio.h> 
int main(void) 
{ 
	int new = 5;
	printf("%d", new); 
}
The program will compile and execute without any errors in C and C++.

In C++, if you try to use the keyword "new" as a variable name, you will get a compiler error. But in this program, since the variable is declared and initialized before the printf statement, it will be printed correctly in both C and C++.
